            <p>
                The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of
                choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization.
                Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite
                the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of
                loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators such as
                <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554">
                reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles</a>. If you have a dog, it is
                important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed
                your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will
                find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
                stages of their lives.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Diet & Exercice</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout dogs‚Äô lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature.
                Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per
                day when they are about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be
                reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally
                reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog‚Äôs typical body mass is
                composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water.
                The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a> say
                just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can
                cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
            </p>
            <p>
                Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy,
                as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed 
                and size differences, but generally a range of 30‚Äì120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day!
                Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading
                this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog does not
                mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose
                from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and
                do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require supervision.
            </p>

            <h2>Grooming & Handling</h2>
            <p>
                Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush frequently
                to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
                difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily
                wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dog‚Äôs health but can be an exercise depending
                on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a
                rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic
                reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog,
                you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with
                one hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under
                the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and
                rear as you lift.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Vaccinations & Medications</h2>
            <p>
                You should <span style="font-weight: bold;">always</span> consult with your veterinarian, but there
                is a core set of vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to
                things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on
                the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include
                <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet">
                Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.</a>
