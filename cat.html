            <br>
            <p>
                Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently
                the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique
                documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and
                practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member
                regardless of breed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Zero to Four Weeks</h2>
            <p>
                It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant
                 or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten‚Äôs growth closely
                 to make sure its growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a
                  sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle
                  or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include
                  the following:
                  <ul>
                    <li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
                    <li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
                    <li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary condition</li>
                  </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
            <p>
                Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth.
                According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens at
                this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If
                your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat
                food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and
                wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult
                with your veterinarian for recommendations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>One Year to Seven Year</h2>
            <p>
                This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level of
                activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
                recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat
                meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other
                weight-related feline ailments.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Seven Years and More</h2>
            <p>
                Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes.
                Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you
                are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such
                as "salmon") and <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> just a category (such as fish). This
                usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
